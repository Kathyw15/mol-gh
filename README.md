# Welcome to The Missing Objects Library (MOL)

Welcome to the Missing Object Library (MOL) Dataset GitHub repository! This dataset is a carefully curated collection of 3D models spanning a wide range of identities, cultures, and experiences, with the aim of promoting inclusivity and diversity in digital asset libraries.


The Missing Object Library (MOL), a web-based curated repository of hand-made digital objects that fill a void in the existing offerings from companies who provide fully rendered 3D models to creative professionals around the world. MOL disrupts historical gatekeeping performed by “neutral” marketplaces by offering 3D modeled objects with an intersectional lens spanning a wide range of identities beyond the white, cis, heteronormative domain. 

## Description

The MOL dataset consists of unique 3D models contributed by a diverse group of artists, designers, historians, anthropologists, and students from around the globe. The models in this dataset are designed to fill the gaps left by commercial 3D image libraries, which often perpetuate a homogenized view of the world. The dataset includes models that represent various social categorizations, such as race, class, gender, and disability, with a focus on underrepresented objects and experiences.

## Features

- Handmade 3D models in various file formats, suitable for a wide range of applications
- Metadata files with detailed descriptions of each model, including the creator's name, object category, and cultural background
- Curated tags and cataloging system for easy navigation and searchability
- Models from a variety of domains, such as cultural artifacts, ecosystems, vanishing flora and fauna, mental and physical health supports, religious and ritual objects, and accurate bodies that reflect a range of ethnicities and abilities
